<h2>Ehcache 3.5 is now available!</h2>
<p>
  This version of Ehcache strengthens the distributed caching capabilities via improved support for cache resiliency when operating in less stable environments.
</p>
<p>
  In addition as of this version Ehcache requires Java 8+.
</p>
<p>
  Watch for continued rapid improvements to features, stability and performance of the 3.x line throughout the coming months!
</p>
  As a reminder, Ehcache 3 introduced the following:
  <ul>
      <li>Revamped API that leverages Java generics and simplifies Cache interactions,</li>
      <li>Full compatibility with javax.cache API (JSR-107),</li>
      <li>Offheap storage capabilities, including offheap only caches,</li>
      <li>Out of the box Spring Caching and Hibernate integration thanks to the javax.cache support,</li>
      <li>And many more ...</li>
  </ul>
  "Official" builds are available on the project's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases" target="_blank">release page</a> or from Maven Central - see below.
